# GIFTastic

## Created by Lynn Tang

### Design
This page was built using the Giphy API. Users can click on any topic buttons (in this case, verbs) and the gifs from giphy.com will lay itself out on the screen in its still form. When you click on the images, they will animate and go back to being still when clicked again. There is also a form to create your own button and the same functions will work. 

### How I made it
There are the basic steps to achieve this project, one task must be done before moving forward.
- Create the main set of buttons to test the API key
- Grab the data using the Ajax method
- Slowly build more buttons when the users input their value into the box.
- Finish the aesthetics
- Add extra features to the incoming giphys 
    - animate and pause when clicked on
    - ratings for appropriate results (rated g)
    
    ### Improvements
This assignment has a lot of potential to become a lot of things. In the future I would like to add more interactive things to the giphys such as dragging and dropping them into a built in folder so that you could view them later. Also being able to add a share button to social media platforms because gifs are super cool to pass a long :)
